## Portfolio

Hi, Welcome to my digital portfolio, here I share my public work. Hope you like it and i'm open to feedback via my email or dm :)

### Data Science Trends

In this project I tried to describe what data science stack currently in trend. This would help me and others to decide what new stack to learn.

**Built with:**

- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)

### Data Visualization with Web Applications

In this project I use worldbank data to visualize Indonesia growth in the past 60 years. I mostly use energy consumption and economic growth over time to be visualised.

**Built With:**

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

### Data Engineering Disaster Pipeline

In this project, I try to create a model to predict what actually survivor need based on given text and categorize them into 36 categories. This will help volunteers to prepare and give what the survivor really needs.

**Built with:**

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/)

### Churn Prediction Using ML

In subscription based service, churing is when user stop using the paid service. Since loss of service subscribers is a big lost, We need to predict whether user will churn based on their in app activity. This project I use Sparkify 12 GB dataset provided by Udacity. I use machine learning algorithm to predict whether user will churn or not.

**Built with:**

- [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
