## Churn Prediction Using ML

### About the Project

In subscription based service, churing is when user stop using the paid service. Since loss of service subscribers is a big lost, We need to predict whether user will churn based on their in app activity. This project I use Sparkify 12 GB dataset provided by Udacity. I use machine learning algorithm to predict whether user will churn or not.
